# Jon Duckett Books

Working from Jon Duckett's books on [HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com) (and later [JavaScript and jQuery](http://javascriptbook.com)) to improve my confidence with front-end skills.

The web development bootcamp I attended advertised that HTML and CSS would be taught. In reality the content was quite minimal and a lot of knowledge was supposed. I had no prior experience of either language and it made some aspects of the course frustrating. This is my attempt to address that by exploring some of the fundamentals outside the setting of a highly intensive course.
