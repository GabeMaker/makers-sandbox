Learning PHP

##### HowManyFlips.php

My first script, based on an exercise from Codecademy. It simulates tossing a coin, stopping whenever a certain number of heads (by default 3) occur consecutively. It then announces the number of the flip where the sequence of heads started.

**Use:** from command line enter `php HowManyFlips.php [h]` where `h` is the number of consecutive heads required.


##### str_calc.php

Working on the string calculator suggested by [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) as a way to learn TDD. Just experimenting without TDD at this stage while learning about functions in PHP.
