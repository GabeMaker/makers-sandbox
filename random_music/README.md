# Random Page Number generator

As a person with awful taste in and knowledge of music I want to catch up on tracks I haven't heard from [1001 Songs: You Must Hear Before You Die](http://www.amazon.co.uk/1001-Songs-Must-Hear-Before/dp/1844037363)

To keep this daunting self-improvement plan manageable, I only want to check out 5 tracks a day. These tracks will be added to Spotify playlists. I want to:
- generate these tracks randomly by giving me the page from the book where the track is featured.
- not select tracks already chosen.
- be able to select which of 4 eras (pre-80's, 1980-1995, 1996-2004, 2005-present) to chose the random tracks from.
