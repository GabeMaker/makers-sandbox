# Boris Bikes

Reviewing Makers Academy week 1 materials (they have changed since I did the course)

Boris Bikes serves as an introduction to the following:

- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
- How BDD relates to Test Driven Development (TDD)
- The process of domain modeling for Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

*"We are going to create a simple system to support Boris Bikes in London. Our system will allow members of the public to remove and return bikes from docking stations. Occasionally the bikes may break, and then they will be unavailable for rental. There will be a garage to fix broken bikes. Finally, there will be a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage so there are working bikes for members of the public to use."*
